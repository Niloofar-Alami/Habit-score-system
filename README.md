# Habit Score System

A simple Java console application designed to track and evaluate daily habits.  
This project demonstrates the use of methods, arrays, loops, and structured logic to build a clean and functional beginner-level Java program.

## Project Overview
The Habit Score System allows the user to:
- Enter a list of daily habits
- Assign a score (0–10) to each habit
- Calculate the total and average score
- Determine an overall performance level
- Display a structured daily report

This project was created as part of my journey to strengthen my Java fundamentals and practice writing modular, readable code.

## Key Concepts Used
- Methods for modularizing logic  
- Arrays for storing habit names and scores  
- Loops and conditional structures  
- Basic input handling with `Scanner`  
- Simple data processing and output formatting  

## What I Learned
- How to break a problem into smaller reusable methods  
- How to store and process multiple values using arrays  
- How to design a simple console-based user experience  
- How to structure a beginner-level Java project cleanly  

## Code Structure
The project is organized into clear, single-purpose methods:
- `printHeader()` – Displays the program header  
- `getHabits()` – Collects habit names from the user  
- `getScores()` – Collects scores for each habit  
- `calculateTotal()` – Computes the total score  
- `calculateAverage()` – Computes the average score  
- `evaluateLevel()` – Determines performance level  
- `printReport()` – Displays the final summary  

## Future Improvements
- Add file storage to save daily results  
- Add habit categories and weighting  
- Add weekly/monthly report generation  
- Convert the console version into a GUI or web-based app  

## How to Run
Compile and run the program using any Java IDE or terminal:
